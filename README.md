# Google front page project

This repository is the first project of the Foundations path of the Odin Project self-taught project (https://www.theodinproject.com/).
The Odin Project is focused on building knowledge by doing.

The main goal of the "Google homepage" project (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css) is to practice some basics in HTML and CSS: tags, classes, flexbox, etc. 

"Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky" actually lead to a static google search page, which were an additional assignment.
